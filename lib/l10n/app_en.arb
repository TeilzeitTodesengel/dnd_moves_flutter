Each of these attacks is a separate roll and may target different creatures. You may move in between these attacks. When you attack with a light melee weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with your other hand (see the Offhand attack bonus action). You may replace one of your melee attacks with a Grapple or a Shove. Some conditions give advantage on the attack: attacks against blinded, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, stunned, or unconscious targets; melee attacks against prone targets; attacks by invisible or hidden attackers. Some conditions give disadvantage on the attack: attacks against invisible or hidden targets; ranged attacks against prone targets; attacks by blinded, frightened, poisoned, or restrained attackers.",
